# Formstack Database Project

This project is a database that will allow you to create, read, update, and remove users.

I was unable to get the vagrant environment to run under Windows 10. Running the Virtual box and provisioning the vagrant file I get a permission denied when trying to access the public key from GitHub.

### Environment Tools

* Vagrant 1.9.4
* Composer 1.4.1
* PHPUnit 6.1.0
* VirtualBox 5.1.2
* Meekodb 2.3.0
* MySQL Workbench 6.3

---

### Environment Setup

Setup the working environment including adding all of the above mentioned tools and the necessary folders and files.

* MVC framework
* Testing folder
* Database Schema
  * Create a new user table
  * Create all of the columns within the table

---

### Add the code

* Create MySQL connector
* Create User class in models
* Create MenuController class in controllers
* Create the view files
* Comment all of the code

---

### Testing

Normally I would like to create the tests before everything is written and go through TDD style development of writing programs, this verifies that the test will fail before you write the method or class that it is testing. I decided to write the program first because this is my first project in PHP and the first time I have used PHPUnit so I wanted to make sure I was able to write the project correctly first.

* Create Testing file to test the functionality of the methods and classes
* Verify all tests pass
* Update comments and clean up code
